## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
<h3>
A digital advisory platform that provides customized recommendations on crop selection, sowing time, irrigation, nutrient management, pest/disease alerts, and market linkages to smallholders, delivered in local languages and farmer-friendly formats.

1. Registration & Profiling

Farmers register via SMS, WhatsApp, or through extension agents.
Capture: crop, land size, soil type, sowing date, location, resource constraints.

2. Data Integration

> Satellite imagery (Sentinel-2, Landsat) for vegetation indices (NDVI, EVI, soil moisture).
> Weather forecasts from IMD/local services.
> Pest/disease early-warning models.
> Government & NGO databases (subsidies, seed availability).

3. Advisory Engine

> Rule-based agronomy module: fertilizer schedules, irrigation advice, sowing windows.
> ML/AI module: yield prediction, pest risk analysis, anomaly detection.
> Climate-smart module: promotes low-input, sustainable practices (organic alternatives, drought-tolerant varieties).

4. Communication Channels

> SMS (short text tips).
> IVR & voice calls (for low literacy).
> WhatsApp chatbot (for images & two-way queries).
> Mobile app (for advanced users).
> Agent dashboards (for monitoring & farmer support).

5. Feedback Loop

> Farmers send feedback via SMS/voice (“Advice worked/did not work”).
> Extension workers verify on-field results and upload photos.
> Data continuously updates the ML models, improving accuracy over ti
<h3>

## Technical Approach

<h3>
> Data Layer: Remote sensing imagery, IoT sensors, weather APIs, government data.
> Processing Layer: Cloud-based analytics, time-series analysis, crop phenology tracking.
> Advisory Engine: Combination of rule-based agronomy knowledge + AI/ML insights.
> Delivery Layer: SMS/IVR/WhatsApp/App.
> User Interface: Farmer-friendly, multilingual, voice-supported.

1. Remote Sensing & Geospatial Analytics

> NDVI time-series to monitor crop growth and detect stress.
> Soil moisture indices to optimize irrigation scheduling.
> Heat maps of pest infestations.

2. AI/ML Models

> Yield Estimation: LSTM/CNN models trained on NDVI, weather, and soil data.
> Pest/Disease Prediction: Probability models combining climate conditions, crop stage, and historical outbreaks.
> Farmer Image Diagnosis: AI models classify pest/disease images sent via WhatsApp.

3. Rule-Based Advisory System

> Encodes best agronomic practices.
> Localized by crop, region, and farmer’s resource level.
Example: Instead of recommending expensive urea sprays, suggest affordable neem-based biopesticides for low-income farmers.
4. Communication Layer

> Integration with bulk SMS gateways and IVR platforms.
> WhatsApp Business API for image-based diagnosis.
> Offline-first mobile app with lightweight data sync.

5. Security & Privacy

> Farmer data stored securely with unique IDs.
> Minimal PII collected.
> Compliance with local data governance laws.

## Feasibility and Viability
<h3>
1. Technical Feasibility
> Satellite data (Sentinel-2, Landsat) is free and already widely used in agriculture.
> SMS/IVR platforms are affordable and accessible even in remote villages.
> ML/AI models for crop monitoring are proven in research trials and pilot programs.
> Farmer adoption challenges (literacy, trust) can be overcome with voice-based advisories and local agent involvement.

2. Economic Viability
-Pilot costs (1,000 farmers):

> Data & cloud processing: ~$5,000
> SMS/IVR costs: ~$10,000
> Development team (6–12 months): ~$30,000–40,000
> Field operations: ~$15,000
> Total: ~$60,000–70,000 for pilot phase
> Scaling costs drop drastically with more users (bulk SMS discounts, cloud auto-scaling).

-Revenue models:

> Government partnerships (advisory-as-a-service).
> Input suppliers (fertilizers, seeds) pay for advisory sponsorship.
> Cooperatives & NGOs purchase farmer insights.

3.  Operational Viability
> Barriers: digital literacy, phone access, trust.
-Mitigation:
> Local-language IVR & voice.
> Demonstration farms and field schools.
> Farmer-to-farmer ambassadors.
